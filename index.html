<p><strong>Kinetic model of matter</strong> A model allowing us to explain the properties of matter and changes of phase in terms of the arrangement of the particles, their motion, and the attractive forces between them</p>



<h4 id="atomic-or-molecular-spacing">Atomic or molecular spacing</h4>

<p>The density of any substance in kilograms per metre cubed is given by  <br>
density (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18845">kg\ m^{-3}</script>) <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18846">=</script> mass of one molecule <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18847">(kg</script>) <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18848">\times</script> number of molecules per cubic metre (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18849">m^{-3}</script>) </p>

<p>The mass of one molecule of water is the same for all three phases, so the density is directly proportional to the number of molecules per cubic metre.</p>

<p>Assume that the molecules behave like small spheres. <br>
Placing them in a cube of volume 1 metre cubed. <br>
If the distance between is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18850">x</script>, then the number along one edge is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18851">\frac 1 x</script> and the number in the entire box is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18852">\left(\frac 1 x\right)^3</script>.</p>

<p>More generally, suppose there is a volume <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18853">V</script> of a substance composed of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18854">n</script> molecules. <br>
We have <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18855">n = \left(\dfrac{\sqrt[3]{v}}{x}\right)^3 = \left(\dfrac{|v| (m)}{x}\right)^3</script> </p>

<p>Example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18856">64g</script> of copper contains <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18857">6.02\times10^{23}</script> atoms of copper. Copper has a density of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18858">8900\ kg\ m^{-3}</script> at room temperature. <br>
  Estimate: <br>
  The number of copper atoms present in <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18859">1\ kg</script> of copper <br>
  <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18860">\frac{1000}{64} \times 6.02\times10^{23} = 9.40625\times10^{24}</script></p>
  
  <p>The number of copper atoms present in <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18861">1\ m^3</script> of copper <br>
   <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18862">\frac{8900 \times 1000}{64} \times 6.02\times10^{23} = 8.3715625\times10^{28}</script></p>
  
  <p>The diameter of a copper atom <br>
    Using the previous answer we have <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18863">\left(\frac{1}{x^3}\right) = 8.3715625\times10^{28}</script> giving <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18864">x^3 = \frac{1}{8.3715625\times10^{28}}</script> and finally <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18865"> x = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{8.3715625\times10^{28}}} = 2.2859382363\times10^{-10}</script></p>

<h4 id="change-of-phase">Change of phase</h4>

<p>Changing phase requires either an input of energy of a removal of energy.</p>

<p>Heating a solid will cause it to melt and become a liquid. Further heating of the liquid will cause it to evaporate and become a gas. <br>
This is due to the energy of the particles increasing as energy is supplied. The extra energy results in the particles moving further and further apart until they have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction to their adjacent particles.</p>

<p>Conversely, removing thermal energy from a system will reduce the energy of the particles causing them to move closer together, leading to condensation and freezing.</p>



<h3 id="internal-energy">Internal energy</h3>

<p><strong>Internal energy</strong> the sum of the randomly distributed kinetic and potential energies of all the atoms or molecules within a system</p>

<p>The kinetic energy of the system is due to the movement of the particles within the system.</p>

<p>The potential energy of the system is stored in the bonds and intermolecular forces that exist between the particles. <br>
This stored energy will be released when the attractive forces between particles are overcome, such as during melting or evaporating.</p>



<h4 id="internal-energies-for-solids-and-liquids">Internal energies for solids and liquids</h4>

<p>In solids, the particles’ kinetic energy is usually in the form of vibrational motion as the particles each oscillate about their respective equilibrium separations. This gives varying kinetic energy. <br>
The total internal energy is the sum of all the kinetic and potential energies within the solid.</p>

<p>Two uncharged atoms exert forces on each other due to the repulsive forces between their electron clouds and the attraction between the protons of each atom and the electrons of the other.</p>

<p>At the equilibrium separation, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18916">r_0</script>, the attractive and repulsive forces are exactly in balance. <br>
For spaces closer than the equilibrium separation, the atoms repel each other, and for spaces larger than this the atoms attract.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/afm/images/force%20graph.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>The equilibrium separation represents the minimum potential energy, and is therefore the preferred separation of the solid.</p>

<p>As the temperature of a solid or liquid increases, the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules present within the system increases as the vibrations increase in amplitude. Potential energy will also increase slightly as the mean separation between the atoms increases slightly.</p>

<h4 id="internal-energy-for-a-gas">Internal energy for a gas</h4>

<p>Particles in a gas are able to move freely, and the particles’ kinetic energy therefore takes the form of translational motion. <br>
The particles move randomly with different speeds and directions inside their confined space, bounding off each other and the wals of their container as they do so.</p>

<p>The motion of the atoms or molecules gives them enough kinetic energy to move far apart. <br>
As the separation increases, the force between the two atoms or molecules decreases. <br>
The effect of intermolecular forces is small (zero for an ideal gas). This means that the potential energy component of the internal energy of a gas is very small.</p>

<p>If any system of gas particles is at a fixed temperature, there will be a distribution of kinetic energies among the molecules.  <br>
The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution models this. <br>

<h4 id="internal-energy-during-change-of-phase">Internal energy during change of phase</h4>

<p>When a material changes phase, it does not undergo any change in temperature. Therefore, the kinetic energy component of the internal energy does not change. <br>
The potential energy, however, does change. </p>

<h3 id="brownian-motion">Brownian motion</h3>

<p><strong>Brownian motion</strong> The random movement of small visible particles suspended in a fluid due to collisions with much smaller, randomly moving atoms or molecules of the fluid</p>

<p>Brownian motion was first observed in 1827 by Robert Brown when he observed the motion of pollen particles in water.</p>

<p>Brownian motion can be observed with a microscope and a focused filament lamp.</p>

<p>In accordance with the kinetic model of matter, all particles above absolute zero in temperature are in constant motion. The movement cannot however be accurately predicted as there are so many particles moving.</p>

<h4 id="pattern-of-movement-of-solids-liquids-and-gases">Pattern of movement of solids, liquids, and gases</h4>

<p>When a solid is heated it will experience a rise in temperature, and the kinetic energy of its particles will increase. As the material is solid, the position of each atom, ion, or molecule will not change, since the particles are held in place by interatomic or intermolcular forces. <br>
The increase in kinetic energy will result in greater vibration of the particles in the solid around their respective equilibrium positions.</p>

<p>In a liquid, the same effect takes place. This time, a small amount of translational kinetic energy will be added to the increase in vibrational kinetic energy, since the molecules are now ale to move past one another from place to place.</p>

<p>In a gas, almost all of the kinetic energy is translational as the particles move from place to place,.</p>

<h4 id="aerosols">Aerosols</h4>

<p>The smell of a perfume or air freshener quickly moves across a room. This movement, called diffusion, is not Brownian motion but instead convection.</p>

<h3 id="specific-heat-capacity">Specific heat capacity</h3>

<p><strong>Specific heat capacity</strong> The specific heat capacity, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-19123">c</script>, of a substance is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-19124">1\ kg</script> of the substance by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-19125">1\ K</script>. (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-19126">J\ kg^{-1}\ K^{-1}</script>)</p>

<p>When energy is supplied to a body of mass <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-19127">m</script> by heating, the kinetic energy of its particles will increase and its temperature will rise.</p>

<p>The amount that the temperature increases or decreases is proportional to the mass of the object, the specific heat capacity of the object, and the energy supplied.</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-20334">E = mc\Delta \theta</script></p>

<ul>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20335">E</script> is the change in thermal energy (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20336">J</script>)</li>

<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20339">c</script> is the specific heat capacity of the object (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20340">J\ kg^{-1}\ K^{-1}</script>)</li>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20341">\Delta \theta</script> is the change in temperature (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20342">K</script> or <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20343">^\circ{}C</script>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Example </p>

<ol>
<li>Insulate  the material being heated and use a lid for liquids to ensure that as much as possible of the thermal energy supplied to the system is used to increase the temperature of the material. The temperature change should be as high as possible, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20422">\Delta \theta > 20K</script>, so as to reduce percentage uncertainty.</li>
<li>Use an ammeter and voltmeter in the heating circuit to determine the power.</li>
<li>Heat the material for a given time, until the required temperature change has been reached, and then calculate the energy expended with <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20423">E = Pt</script>.</li>
<li>Assuming that all of the energy transferred electrically is used to heat the material, use the principle of conservation of energy to give <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20424">E = mc\Delta \theta</script>.</li>

<h3 id="specific-latent-heat">Specific latent heat</h3>

<p><strong>Specific latent heat of fusion (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20499">L_f</script>)</strong> The amount of energy required to change the phase of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20500">1\ kg</script> of a substance from a solid to a liquid</p>

<p><strong>Specific latent heat of vaporisation (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20501">L_v</script>)</strong> The amount of energy required to change the phase of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20502">1\ kg</script> of a substance from a liquid to a gas</p>



<h4 id="changing-phase">Changing phase</h4>

<p>In order for a material to change phase from a solid to a liquid, or from a liquid to a gas, forces of attraction between atoms or ions in the material must be overcome. <br>
In order to separate the particles, work must be done on the material. <br>
The energy required to cause a change of phase is called the latent (hidden) heat.</p>



<h4 id="changes-in-temperature-during-phase-changes">Changes in temperature during  phase changes</h4>

<p>Experiments show that there is no change in temperature for some time at both the melting and the boiling point of a material, even thought thermal energy is being supplied.</p>

<p>When a substance changes phase the temperature remains constant so there is no increase in the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules. The internal energy, however, does change, this is because a change in the forces between molecules during a change in phase produces a change in their potential energy.</p>



<h4 id="specific-latent-heat-of-fusion">Specific latent heat of fusion</h4>

<p>When a substance is at its melting point, the energy required to change the phase <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21299">1\ kg</script> of the substance from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a solid, is called the specific latent heat of fusion (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21300">L_f</script>). <br>
The energy is taken in by the substance when it melts and given out by the substance when it freezes.</p>

<p>The term specific refers to the specific mass of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21301">1\ kg</script> from which the latent heat can be found for any mass. <br>
The latent heat for a mass <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21302">m</script> (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21303">kg</script>) is given by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21304">E = mL</script> </p>

<p>Example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much energy is required to convert <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21305">450\ kg</script> of ice into liquid water, given that the specific latent heat of fusion of water is  <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21306">335000\ J\ kg^{-1}</script> </p>
  
  <p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-21307">\begin{align}E &= mL \\ 
  &= 450\ kg \times 335000\ J\ kg^{-1} \\
  &= 150750000\ J \\
  &\approx 151\ MJ\ (\sim 1.5\times10^8 J) \end{align}</script></p>

<p><img src="http://spaceflight.esa.int/impress/text/education/Images/Solidification/Introduction/Introduction_Image_003.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>A known mass of ice is placed into two funnels, A and B. <br>
The heater in arrangement A is connected to a power supply of known power P.  <br>
The control, B, is not connected to a power supply. <br>
When water starts to drip from the funnels, the heater is switched on. <br>
After 15 minutes the heater is switched off and the mass of the water in both beakers is measured. <br>
The mass of the water in beaker B is the control value, which is to be subtracted from that of A to account for enegy accrued from the surroundings. <br>
We then have that</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-20693">\begin{align}L_f &= \frac{E}{\Delta m} \\
&= \frac{P \times 15 \times 60}{m_A - m_B}\end{align}</script></p>

<h4 id="specific-latent-heat-of-vaporisation">Specific latent heat of vaporisation</h4>

<p>When a substance boils or condenses, the specific latent heat of vaporisation (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20705">L_v</script>) is the amount of energy required to change the phase of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-20706">1\ kg</script> of the substance from a liquid to a gas or vice versa.</p>

<h4 id="determining-the-specific-latent-heat-of-vaporisation">Determining the specific latent heat of vaporisation</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/age16-19/Thermal%20physics/Heat%20energy/text/Latent_heat_measurement/images/1.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>The liquid whose specific latent heat of vaporisation is to be determined is heated to boiling point. <br>
The vapour that is produced passes through the holes and into the condenser. <br>
The vapour is collected for a time, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22886">t</script>, and its mass, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22887">m_1</script>, is determined. <br>
At this point the current in the circuit is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22888">I_1</script>  and the potential difference across the heating coil is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22889">V_1</script>.</p>

<p>By equating electrical energy supplied to thermal energy transferred we have <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22890">V_1 I_1t = m_1L_v + Q</script> where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22891">Q</script> is the thermal energy transferred to the surroundings in time <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22892">t</script>. <br>
The potential difference across the heater and the current flowing through the heater are now changed to new values <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22893">V_2</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22894">I_2</script> respectively. <br>
The mass of water vapour that is produced in the same time, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22895">t</script>, as before is noted and called <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22896">m_2</script>.</p>

<p>This leads to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22897">V_2 I_2 t = m_2 L_v + Q</script>.</p>

<p>The value of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22898">Q</script> will be the same in each case, since the temperature of the apparatus has not changed. <br>
Subtracting the two equations, we can eliminate <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22899">Q</script>, to give <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22900">(V_2 I_2 - V_1 I_1)t = (m_2 - m_1)L_v</script>.</p>

<p>Since we know know the values, the specific latent heat of vaporisation is given by <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22901">L_v = \dfrac{(V_2 I_2 - V_1 I_1)t}{m_2 - m_1}</script></p></div></body>
