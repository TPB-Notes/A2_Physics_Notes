<h3 id="temperature">Temperature</h3>

<p><strong>Kinetic model of matter</strong> A model allowing us to explain the properties of matter and changes of phase in terms of the arrangement of the particles, their motion, and the attractive forces between them</p>



<h4 id="atomic-or-molecular-spacing">Atomic or molecular spacing</h4>

<p>The density of any substance in kilograms per metre cubed is given by  <br>
density (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-3">\text{kg m}^{-3}</script>) <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-4">=</script> mass of one molecule <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5">(\text{kg}</script>) <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6">\times</script> number of molecules per cubic metre (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7">\text{m}^{-3}</script>) </p>

<p>The mass of one molecule of water is the same for all three phases, so the density is directly proportional to the number of molecules per cubic metre.</p>

<p>Assume that the molecules behave like small spheres. <br>
Placing them in a cube of volume 1 metre cubed. <br>
If the distance between is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8">x</script>, then the number along one edge is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-9">\frac 1 x</script> and the number in the entire box is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-10">\left(\frac 1 x\right)^3</script>.</p>

<p>More generally, suppose there is a volume <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-11">V</script> of a substance composed of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-12">n</script> molecules. <br>
We have <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-13">n = \left(\dfrac{\sqrt[3]{v}}{x}\right)^3 = \left(\dfrac{|v| (\text{m})}{x}\right)^3</script> </p>



<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-14">64\text{ g}</script> of copper contains <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-15">6.02\times10^{23}</script> atoms of copper. Copper has a density of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-16">8900\ \text{kg m}^{-3}</script> at room temperature. <br>
  Estimate: <br>
  The number of copper atoms present in <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-17">1\ \text{kg}</script> of copper <br>
  <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18">\frac{1000}{64} \times 6.02\times10^{23} = 9.40625\times10^{24}</script></p>

    Using the previous answer we have <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21">\left(\frac{1}{x^3}\right) = 8.3715625\times10^{28}</script> giving <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22">x^3 = \dfrac{1}{8.3715625\times10^{28}}</script> and finally <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-23"> x = \sqrt[3]{\dfrac{1}{8.3715625\times10^{28}}} \approx 2.2859382363\times10^{-10}</script></p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="change-of-phase">Change of phase</h4>

<p>Changing phase requires either an input of energy of a removal of energy.</p>

<p>Heating a solid will cause it to melt and become a liquid. Further heating of the liquid will cause it to evaporate and become a gas. <br>
This is due to the energy of the particles increasing as energy is supplied. The extra energy results in the particles moving further and further apart until they have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction to their adjacent particles.</p>

<p>Conversely, removing thermal energy from a system will reduce the energy of the particles causing them to move closer together, leading to condensation and freezing.</p>



<h3 id="internal-energy">Internal energy</h3>

<p><strong>Internal energy</strong> the sum of the randomly distributed kinetic and potential energies of all the atoms or molecules within a system</p>

<p>The kinetic energy of the system is due to the movement of the particles within the system.</p>

<p>The potential energy of the system is stored in the bonds and inter-molecular forces that exist between the particles. <br>
This stored energy will be released when the attractive forces between particles are overcome, such as during melting or evaporating.</p>



<h4 id="internal-energies-for-solids-and-liquids">Internal energies for solids and liquids</h4>

<p>In solids, the particles’ kinetic energy is usually in the form of vibrational motion as the particles each oscillate about their respective equilibrium separations. This gives varying kinetic energy. <br>
The total internal energy is the sum of all the kinetic and potential energies within the solid.</p>

<p>Two uncharged atoms exert forces on each other due to the repulsive forces between their electron clouds and the attraction between the protons of each atom and the electrons of the other.</p>

<p>At the equilibrium separation, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-24">r_0</script>, the attractive and repulsive forces are exactly in balance. <br>
For spaces closer than the equilibrium separation, the atoms repel each other, and for spaces larger than this the atoms attract.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/afm/images/force%20graph.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>The equilibrium separation represents the minimum potential energy, and is therefore the preferred separation of the solid.</p>

<p>As the temperature of a solid or liquid increases, the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules present within the system increases as the vibrations increase in amplitude. Potential energy will also increase slightly as the mean separation between the atoms increases slightly.</p>



<h4 id="internal-energy-for-a-gas">Internal energy for a gas</h4>

<p>Particles in a gas are able to move freely, and the particles’ kinetic energy therefore takes the form of translational motion. <br>
The particles move randomly with different speeds and directions inside their confined space, bounding off each other and the wals of their container as they do so.</p>

<p>The motion of the atoms or molecules gives them enough kinetic energy to move far apart. <br>
As the separation increases, the force between the two atoms or molecules decreases. <br>
The effect of intermolecular forces is small (zero for an ideal gas). This means that the potential energy component of the internal energy of a gas is very small.</p>

<p>If any system of gas particles is at a fixed temperature, there will be a distribution of kinetic energies among the molecules.  <br>
The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution models this. <br>

<h4 id="internal-energy-during-change-of-phase">Internal energy during change of phase</h4>

<p>When a material changes phase, it does not undergo any change in temperature. Therefore, the kinetic energy component of the internal energy does not change. <br>
The potential energy, however, does change. </p>



<h3 id="brownian-motion">Brownian motion</h3>

<p><strong>Brownian motion</strong> The random movement of small visible particles suspended in a fluid due to collisions with much smaller, randomly moving atoms or molecules of the fluid</p>

<p>Brownian motion was first observed in 1827 by Robert Brown when he observed the motion of pollen particles in water.</p>

<p>Brownian motion can be observed with a microscope and a focused filament lamp.</p>

<p>In accordance with the kinetic model of matter, all particles above absolute zero in temperature are in constant motion. The movement cannot however be accurately predicted as there are so many particles moving.</p>



<h4 id="pattern-of-movement-of-solids-liquids-and-gases">Pattern of movement of solids, liquids, and gases</h4>

<p>When a solid is heated it will experience a rise in temperature, and the kinetic energy of its particles will increase. As the material is solid, the position of each atom, ion, or molecule will not change, since the particles are held in place by interatomic or intermolcular forces. <br>
The increase in kinetic energy will result in greater vibration of the particles in the solid around their respective equilibrium positions.</p>

<p>In a liquid, the same effect takes place. This time, a small amount of translational kinetic energy will be added to the increase in vibrational kinetic energy, since the molecules are now ale to move past one another from place to place.</p>

<p>In a gas, almost all of the kinetic energy is translational as the particles move from place to place,.</p>



<h4 id="aerosols">Aerosols</h4>

<p>The smell of a perfume or air freshener quickly moves across a room. This movement, called diffusion, is not Brownian motion but instead convection.</p>



<h3 id="specific-heat-capacity">Specific heat capacity</h3>

<p><strong>Specific heat capacity</strong> The specific heat capacity, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-25">c</script>, of a substance is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-26">1\ \text{kg}</script> of the substance by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-27">1\ \text{K}</script>. (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-28">\text{J kg}^{-1}\text{ K}^{-1}</script>)</p>

<p>When energy is supplied to a body of mass <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-29">m</script> by heating, the kinetic energy of its particles will increase and its temperature will rise.</p>

<p>The amount that the temperature increases or decreases is proportional to the mass of the object, the specific heat capacity of the object, and the energy supplied.</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-30">E = mc\Delta \theta</script></p>

<p>where</p>

<ul>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-31">E</script> is the change in thermal energy (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-32">\text{J}</script>)</li>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-33">m</script> is the mass of the body (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-34">\text{kg}</script>)</li>

<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-37">\Delta \theta</script> is the change in temperature (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-38">\text{K}</script> or <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-39">^\circ{}\text{C}</script>)</li>
</ul>



<h5 id="example-1">Example</h5>

<ol>
<li>Insulate  the material being heated and use a lid for liquids to ensure that as much as possible of the thermal energy supplied to the system is used to increase the temperature of the material. The temperature change should be as high as possible, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-46">\Delta \theta > 20K</script>, so as to reduce percentage uncertainty.</li>
<li>Use an ammeter and voltmeter in the heating circuit to determine the power.</li>
<li>Heat the material for a given time, until the required temperature change has been reached, and then calculate the energy expended with <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-47">E = Pt</script>.</li>
<li>Assuming that all of the energy transferred electrically is used to heat the material, use the principle of conservation of energy to give <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-48">E = mc\Delta \theta</script>.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="specific-latent-heat">Specific latent heat</h3>

<p><strong>Specific latent heat of fusion (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-49">L_f</script>)</strong> The amount of energy required to change the phase of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-50">1 \text{ kg}</script> of a substance from a solid to a liquid</p>

<p><strong>Specific latent heat of vaporisation (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-51">L_v</script>)</strong> The amount of energy required to change the phase of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-52">1 \text{ kg}</script> of a substance from a liquid to a gas</p>



<h4 id="changing-phase">Changing phase</h4>

<p>In order for a material to change phase from a solid to a liquid, or from a liquid to a gas, forces of attraction between atoms or ions in the material must be overcome. <br>
In order to separate the particles, work must be done on the material. <br>
The energy required to cause a change of phase is called the latent (hidden) heat.</p>



<h4 id="changes-in-temperature-during-phase-changes">Changes in temperature during  phase changes</h4>

<p>Experiments show that there is no change in temperature for some time at both the melting and the boiling point of a material, even thought thermal energy is being supplied.</p>

<p>When a substance changes phase the temperature remains constant so there is no increase in the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules. The internal energy, however, does change, this is because a change in the forces between molecules during a change in phase produces a change in their potential energy.</p>



<h4 id="specific-latent-heat-of-fusion">Specific latent heat of fusion</h4>

<p>When a substance is at its melting point, the energy required to change the phase <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-53">1\text{ kg}</script> of the substance from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a solid, is called the specific latent heat of fusion (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-54">L_f</script>). <br>
The energy is taken in by the substance when it melts and given out by the substance when it freezes.</p>

<p>The term specific refers to the specific mass of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-55">1\text{ kg}</script> from which the latent heat can be found for any mass. <br>
The latent heat for a mass <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-56">m</script> (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-57">\text{kg}</script>) is given by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-58">E = mL</script> </p>



<h5 id="example-2">Example</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given that the specific latent heat of fusion of water is  <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-2277">335000\text{ J kg}^{-1}</script>, determine how much energy is required to convert <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-2278">450\text{ kg}</script> of ice into liquid water.</p>
  
  <p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-2279">\begin{align}E &= mL \\

  &\approx 151\ (\text{MJ})\ (\sim 1.5\times10^8 \text{ J}) \end{align}</script></p>

<p><img src="http://spaceflight.esa.int/impress/text/education/Images/Solidification/Introduction/Introduction_Image_003.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>A known mass of ice is placed into two funnels, A and B. <br>
The heater in arrangement A is connected to a power supply of known power P.  <br>
The control, B, is not connected to a power supply. <br>
When water starts to drip from the funnels, the heater is switched on. <br>
After 15 minutes the heater is switched off and the mass of the water in both beakers is measured. <br>
The mass of the water in beaker B is the control value, which is to be subtracted from that of A to account for enegy accrued from the surroundings. <br>
We then have that</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-62">\begin{align}L_f &= \frac{E}{\Delta m} \\
&= \frac{P \times 15 \times 60}{m_A - m_B}\end{align}</script></p>



<h4 id="specific-latent-heat-of-vaporisation">Specific latent heat of vaporisation</h4>

<p>When a substance boils or condenses, the specific latent heat of vaporisation (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-63">L_v</script>) is the amount of energy required to change the phase of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-64">1\text{ kg}</script> of the substance from a liquid to a gas or vice versa.</p>



<h4 id="determining-the-specific-latent-heat-of-vaporisation">Determining the specific latent heat of vaporisation</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/age16-19/Thermal%20physics/Heat%20energy/text/Latent_heat_measurement/images/1.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>The liquid whose specific latent heat of vaporisation is to be determined is heated to boiling point. <br>
The vapour that is produced passes through the holes and into the condenser. <br>
The vapour is collected for a time, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-65">t</script>, and its mass, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-66">m_1</script>, is determined. <br>
At this point the current in the circuit is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-67">I_1</script>  and the potential difference across the heating coil is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-68">V_1</script>.</p>

<p>By equating electrical energy supplied to thermal energy transferred we have <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-69">V_1 I_1t = m_1L_v + Q</script> where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-70">Q</script> is the thermal energy transferred to the surroundings in time <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-71">t</script>. <br>
The potential difference across the heater and the current flowing through the heater are now changed to new values <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-72">V_2</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-73">I_2</script> respectively. <br>
The mass of water vapour that is produced in the same time, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-74">t</script>, as before is noted and called <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-75">m_2</script>.</p>

<p>This leads to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-76">V_2 I_2 t = m_2 L_v + Q</script>.</p>

<p>The value of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-77">Q</script> will be the same in each case, since the temperature of the apparatus has not changed. <br>
Subtracting the two equations, we can eliminate <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-78">Q</script>, to give <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-79">(V_2 I_2 - V_1 I_1)t = (m_2 - m_1)L_v</script>.</p>

<p>Since we know know the values, the specific latent heat of vaporisation is given by <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-80">L_v = \dfrac{(V_2 I_2 - V_1 I_1)t}{m_2 - m_1}</script></p>



<h3 id="the-amount-of-substance">The amount of substance</h3>



<h4 id="moles">Moles</h4>

<p>It is more useful to use the SI unit for the amount of a substance than to simply count the number of molecules in the substance. <br>
One mole of any substance is the amount of the substance which contains as many atoms, molecules, or ions as there are atoms in <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-81">12\text{ g}</script> of carbon-12.  <br>
The mass of one mole of a substance is called the molar mass. <br>
The molar mass of a substance in grams is determined by its relative atomic mass, or the molecular mass, multiplied by the number of particles in one mole. <br>
This number is the Avogadro constant <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-82">N_A = 6.02\times10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}</script></p>



<h4 id="molar-mass-of-monatomic-gases">Molar mass of monatomic gases</h4>

<p>Monatomic gases are composed of single atoms, such as helium. The mass of one mole of a monatomic gas is equal to its relative atomic mass.</p>



<h4 id="molar-mas-for-diatomic-gases">Molar mas for diatomic gases</h4>

<p>Nitrogen and oxygen are diatomic. Nitrogen and oxygen gas exist as molecules, each containing two atoms. <br>
Nitrogen has a relative atomic mass of 14, and that of oxygen is 16. <br>
Since they are diatomic, a mole of nitrogen gas (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-2284">N_2</script>) will have a mass of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-2285">28\text{ g}</script> and a mole of oxygen gas (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-2286">O_2</script>) will have a mass of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-2287">32\text{ g}</script>.</p>

<h4 id="the-relationship-between-avogadros-number-na-the-number-of-moles-n-and-the-number-of-particles-n">The relationship between Avogadro’s number (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-87">N_A</script>), the number of moles (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-88">n</script>), and the number of particles (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-89">N</script>)</h4>

<p>One mole of a substance contains <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-90">N_A</script> particles</p>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-91">n</script> moles of a substance contain <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-92">nN_A</script> particles</p>

<p>The number of particles present in a gas is equal to the number of moles multiplied by Avogadro’s number. <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-93">N = nN_A</script></p>

<h3 id="the-kinetic-theory-of-pressure-of-a-gas">The kinetic theory of pressure of a gas</h3>

<p><strong>Ideal gas</strong> A gas that has internal energy only in the form of random kinetic energy <br>
<strong>Mean square speed <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-102">\overline{c^2}</script></strong> The mean value fo the square of the velocity, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-103">c</script>, for a large number of gas particles moving randomly in a gas <br>
<strong>Root mean square speed </strong> The square root of the mean square speed</p>



<h4 id="assumptions-of-the-kinetic-model-of-gas">Assumptions of the kinetic model of gas</h4>

<ul>
<li>The gas contains a large number of particles</li>
<li>The particles move rapidly and randomly</li>
<li>All collisions are perfectly elastic, conserving kinetic energy</li>
<li>There are negligible attractive forces between particles during collisions</li>
<li>The time for a collision to happen is negligible compared to the time between collisions</li>
<li>Particles have a negligible volume compared with the volume of gas in the container</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="ideal-and-real-gases">Ideal and real gases</h4>

<p>In reality the forces between the particles in a gas are not negligible and cannot be ignored. However, real gases will behave like ideal gases if they are at low pressure and a temperature significantly above their boiling point. <br>
The internal energy of an ideal gas is composed entirely of the kinetic energy of its fast-moving particles, since we assume that there are no inter-molecular forces that could lead to additional potential energy in the system.</p>



<h4 id="pressure-of-gases">Pressure of gases</h4>

<p>A gas in a container exerts pressure on the container walls due to collisions of gas molecules with the container walls. <br>
Pressure is a vector quantity, since it has both a magnitude and a direction. <br>
Pressure is defined as the force, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-104">F</script>, acting perpendicular to an area, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-105">A</script>. (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-106">\text{Pa}</script>) (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-107">\text{N m}^{-2}</script>).</p>

<p>Gases are likely to have large numerical values of pressure because gas molecules may be travelling fast and there are huge numbers of them. <br>
Atmospheric pressure is approximately <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-108">100000\text{ Pa}</script>, the reason that objects are not crushed under this pressure is that there are equal and opposite forces acting outwards.</p>



<h4 id="using-the-kinetic-theory-to-obtain-an-equation-for-the-pressure-of-an-ideal-gas">Using the kinetic theory to obtain an equation for the pressure of an ideal gas</h4>

<p>Suppose there are three molecules moving in a cubic box of side length <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-109">L</script>. The molecules each have mass <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-110">m</script> and are travelling at speed <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-111">v</script> parallel to each of the axis respectively.</p>

<p>Let us consider only the first molecule, travelling parallel to the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-112">x</script> axis, and one wall of the box. <br>
When the molecule hits the wall, it will rebound with velocity <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-113">v</script> since since all collisions with the wall are perfectly elastic.</p>

<p>Initially, the momentum of the molecule is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-114">-mv</script>. Having collided with the wall and rebounded, its momentum will become <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-115">mv</script>, giving a change in momentum of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-116">2mv</script>.</p>

<p>The molecule will collide with the wall again after it has travelled a distance of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-117">2L</script> across the box and back to the same wall.  <br>
The time it takes to do this is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-118">\frac{2L}{v}</script> </p>

<p>By Newton’s second law of motion, the force, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-119">F</script>, exerted on the wall will be equal to the rate of change of momentum, so we have <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-120">F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{2mv}{\frac{2L}{v}} = \frac{mv^2}{L}</script> <br>
From Newton’s third law, the molecule exerts an equal and opposite force on the wall.</p>

<p>The pressure on the wall is given by force over area, which in this case is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-121">\frac{F}{L^2} = \frac{mv^2}{L^3}</script>.</p>

<p>Since the box is a cube, we can replace <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-122">L^3</script> with the term <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-123">V</script> to denote the volume, giving <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-124">p = \frac{mv^2}{V}</script>.</p>

<p>If there are <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-125">N</script> gas molecules in the box the total pressure exerted on the wall will be given by the sum of the individual forces acting on the area of that wall. <br>
In reality, the molecules move randomly in all directions, not in one direction as is modelled here. <br>
Only changes of momentum in the direction perpendicular to the wall will cause an impact force on the wall.</p>

<p>For <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-126">N</script> molecules travelling in the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-127">x</script> direction, the pressure exerted on the wall will be given by </p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-128">p = \frac{m}{V}(v_{1x}^2 + v_{2x}^2 + ... + v_{Nx}^2)</script></p>

<p>This can be related to the mean value of the square of the component in the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-129">x</script> direction, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-130">\overline{v}_x^2</script>, where  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-131">\overline{v}_x^2 = \dfrac{v_{1x}^2 + v_{2x}^2 + ... + v_{Nx}^2}{N}</script></p>

<p>The pressure on one wall is then given by </p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-132">p = \dfrac{Nm\overline{v}_x^2}{V}</script></p>

<p>Finally we must consider the motion of all the molecules that have components of velocity in the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-133">y</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-134">z</script> axies.</p>

<p>If the velocity of a gas molecule is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-135">c</script> which can be resolved into components of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-136">v_x, v_y,</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-137">v_z</script>, it can be shown that  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-138">c^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2</script></p>

<p>From the assumption of kinetic theory, the velocity is in a random direction, so the mean velocity component will be equal in every direction and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-139">v_x^2 = v_y^2 = v_z^2</script>. Hence it is possible to say that <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-140">\overline{v_x^2} = \frac{\overline{c^2}}{3}</script>.</p>

<p>The total pressure is then <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-141">p = \frac{\frac 1 3 Nm\overline{c^2}}{V}</script>, which can also be written <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-142">pV = \frac 1 3 Nm\overline{c^2}.</script> <br>
Alternatively, since the total mass of the gas is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-143">Nm</script> and since the density, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-144">\rho</script>, of the gas is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-145">\frac{Nm}{V}</script>, we obtain an expression for the pressure of an ideal gas as <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-146">p = \frac 1 3 \rho \overline{c^2}</script>.</p>



<h3 id="investigating-gases">Investigating gases</h3>

<h4 id="investigating-boyles-law">Investigating Boyle’s law</h4>

<p>Boyle’s law can be demonstrated with a measuring tube closed at one end and containing air above some oil. <br>
The pressure on the oil can be increased by a foot pump, and the volume of air in the measuring tube can then be re-measured. <br>

<p>Collectively, these laws are called the gas laws. <br>
The laws apply to most gases, but break down if the gas is close to its boiling point or at a very high pressure. <br>
The laws also only hold for temperature values expressed in kelvin.</p>



<h4 id="the-ideal-gas-equation-1">The ideal gas equation</h4>

<p>In an ideal gas, there are no intermolecular forces between the gas atoms or molecules. An ideal gas will obey the gas laws exactly.</p>

<p>By combining the three gas laws we obtain <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-166">\frac{pV}{T} = k</script> for a fixed mass of gas. <br>
The constant is dependent on the amount of gas present, the number of moles, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-167">n</script>. Introducing the molar gas constant, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-168">R</script> , we obtain <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-169">pV = nRT</script>, where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-170">R = 8.31 \text{ J mol}^{-1}\text{ K}^{-1}</script>.</p>

<h3 id="the-conical-pendulum">The conical pendulum</h3>

<p>A ball swinging from a conical pendulum is in equilibrium vertically, but there is a resultant fore on the ball directed horizontally towards the point below the vertical.</p>

<p>The vertical component of the force must be equal and opposite to the weight of the ball, and the horizontal component must accelerate the ball towards the center of its motion in its horizontal plane.</p>

At the bottom the weight of the person acts in the opposite direction to the centripetal acceleration. The resultant force is then <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-269">\frac{mv^2}{r} + mg</script>.</p>



<h2 id="oscillations">Oscillations</h2>

<p>Simple harmonic motion is oscillatory motion such that the acceleration, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-270">a</script>, of the oscillating body is directly proportional to the displacement, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-271">x</script>, of the body from its equilibrium position and is always directed towards that point.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-272">a = -kx</script></p>

<p>The magnitude of the acceleration increases as the displacement increases. Acceleration is maximum when the displacement, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-273">x</script>, is maximum at <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-274">x = A</script>.</p>

<p>The constant of the equation can be written in terms of the frequency, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-275">f</script>, or angular frequency, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-276">\omega</script>, of the oscillations giving</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A simple pendulum bob is displaced from its equilibrium position so that it has an amplitude of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-281">20\text{ cm}</script>.

<h4 id="the-solution-to-a-omega2-x">The solution to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-292">a = -\omega^2 x</script></h4>

<p>The two solutions are <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-293">x = A\sin(\omega t)</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-294">x = A\cos(\omega t)</script>, where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-295">t</script> is the time in seconds since the oscillatory motion began. <br>
These equations satisfy the following characteristics of simple harmonic motion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Velocity changes smoothly and is symmetric around the equilibrium position</li>
<li>Velocity at maximum displacement is zero</li>
<li>Maximum acceleration occurs at the maximum displacement</li>
<li>Maximum velocity occurs at the equilibrium position</li>
</ul>

<p>The two solutions are out of phase with each other by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-296">\frac \pi 2</script> radians. This allows us to use <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-297">x = A\cos(\omega t)</script> when the timing of the simple harmonic motion starts from the point where the pendulum is released at its maximum displacement. <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-298">x = A\sin(\omega t)</script> is used to describe the motion of the pendulum body when it starts such that the displacement is 0 at <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-299">t = 0</script>.</p>

<h4 id="energy-interchanges-during-simple-harmonic-motion">Energy interchanges during simple harmonic motion</h4>

<p>During one complete oscillation of a body performing simple harmonic motion, the interchange of energy between kinetic and potential energy follows a quadratic curve.</p>



<h4 id="energy-changes-for-a-mass-on-a-spring">Energy changes for a mass on a spring</h4>

<p>The total energy of the system must remain constant while the mass oscillates. Any gain in kinetic energy is balanced by a loss in potential energy, however there are two types of potential energy which must be considered. The spring gains elastic potential energy when it is extended and the mass gains gravitational potential energy when it rises.</p>

<p>The elastic potential energy stored by a spring when stretched by a distance <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-305">x</script> is given by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-306">\frac 1 2 k x^2</script>.

<h3 id="damping">Damping</h3>

<p><strong>Damping</strong> Damping forces reduce the amplitude of an oscillation with time, due to energy being removed from the oscillating system</p>



<h4 id="uses-of-damping">Uses of damping</h4>

<p>Damping affects the rate of decay of vibrations. <br>
Damping can occur in oscillations due to the effect of air resistance or other frictional forces, this is referred to as natural damping. <br>
The process of deliberately reducing the amplitude of an oscillation is called artificial damping, and it is used to ensure that the amplitude of vibrations dies down quickly.</p>

<p>In a car’s shock absorber energy is removed from the system by dissipation through the hydraulic fluid as it is compressed.</p>



<h4 id="effects-of-damping">Effects of damping</h4>

<p>If only small damping forces exist, which is known as light damping, the period of the oscillation is almost unchanged, but the amplitude of the oscillation will gradually decrease. <br>
As the damping force increases, rate at which the energy is removed from the system increases, there is a more noticeable reduction in amplitude and the period of oscillation will decrease slightly. <br>
In the case of very heavy damping, no oscillation occurs, and the body slowly moves back to its equilibrium position.</p>

<p><strong>Critical damping</strong> Damping which provides the quickest approach to zero amplitude for a damped oscillator</p>



<h5 id="example-13">Example</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>State and describe the nature of the damping that takes place in the following <br>
  a) A playground swing that continues to oscillate backwards and forwards for minutes once a child has jumped from the moving swing <br>
  Light natural damping is observed as the fritcional forces are low in magnitude and occur as a result of air resistance and friction in the support <br>
  b) A test tube that bobs up and down in water for a few seconds before coming to rest <br>
  This is heavier, artificial damping being observed since the oscillations die quickly due to the deliberate use of water <br>
  c) A test tube that oscillates in treacle for less than one oscillation before stopping <br>
  This is very heavy damping, which in this case can also be referred to as critical damping because there is no oscillation occurring</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="resonance">Resonance</h3>

<p><strong>Natural frequency</strong> The frequency at which a system will oscillate when no external force is acting <br>
<strong>Free oscillations</strong> Free oscillations occur when there is no external periodic force. The system oscillates at its natural frequency <br>
<strong>Forced oscillations</strong> Forced oscillations occur when an external force or driving force is applied to keep the body oscillating. The system oscillates at the frequency of the driving force <br>
<strong>Driving frequency</strong> The frequency of the driving force applied to an oscillating object <br>
<strong>Resonance</strong> Resonance occurs in a forced oscillation when the driving frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the system being forced to oscillate. This results in the body oscillating at its natural frequency and maximum amplitude</p>

<p><img src="http://www.antonine-education.co.uk/Image_library/Physics_4/Further_Mechanics/Bartons_Pendula.JPG" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>In the figure above, a heavy mass is pulled in the axis perpendicular in the horizontal to the bar. Once released, the heavy mass will perform free oscillations and oscillate at its natural frequency. <br>
As the heavy mass swings backwards and forwards, energy is transferred along the string to the other pendulums which will also start to swing in the same plane.</p>

<p>Since the length of the pendulum determines its natural frequency, the pendulum of the same length as the driver pendulum will oscillate at its natural frequency. <br>
The phase difference between the oscillation of the driver pendulum and the driven pendulum will be <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-309">\frac \pi 2</script> rad.</p>



<h4 id="practical-uses-and-dangers-of-resonance">Practical uses and dangers of resonance</h4>

<p>There are many practical and useful applications of resonance. These include the tuning circuits that respond to a particular radio or TV frequency, microwave ovens cooking food due to the resonance of water molecules at a particular frequency, and the timing mechanisms of some clocks which are controlled by the resonant vibrations of quartz crystals.</p>

<p>Conversely, resonance can have dangerous consequences. <br>
Care must be taken to eliminate unwanted vibrations at a resonant frequency. <br>
A combination of damping to quickly reduce the amplitude of vibrations at the natural frequency and careful choice of the dimensions of an object is used.</p>



<h2 id="gravitational-fields">Gravitational fields</h2>

<p><strong>Gravitational field</strong> The region around a body in which other bodies will feel a force due to the mass of the body</p>

<p><strong>Gravitational field lines</strong> Lines which how the shape of the field. The direction of the field line at a point is the direction in which a small mass would move when placed at that point</p>

<p><strong>Gravitational field strength</strong> At any point in a gravitational field the gravitational field strength is the force acting per unit mass at that point, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-310">g = \frac F m\ \  (\text{N kg}^{-1})</script></p>



<h4 id="the-earths-gravitational-field">The Earth’s gravitational field</h4>

<p>The field lines are always directed along a radius towards the centre of the Earth</p>

<p>The gravitational field is stronger when the lines are closer together</p>

<p>The field lines are radial in nature. The distance between two field lines at a distance twice as far away from the centre will be twice as large as that at the original distance from the centre.</p>

<p>As the distance from a mass to a point in space increases by a factor of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-311">r</script> the gravitational field strength decreases by a factor of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-312">r^2</script>.</p>

<p>Over short distances at the surface of the Earth, there is very little variation in the gravitational field strength. The field is said to be uniform over short distances, this would appear as parallel field lines over a short range. <br>
It is only over a large distance from the Earth’s surface that the field lines diverge and we observe the radial nature of the field.</p>



<h4 id="calculating-gravitational-field-strength">Calculating gravitational field strength</h4>

<p>The gravitational field strength of the Earth varies at the surface of the Earth because matter is not uniformly distributed across the Earth and so the gravitational force can vary slightly.</p>



<h4 id="the-relationship-between-acceleration-due-to-gravity-and-the-gravitational-field-strength">The relationship between acceleration due to gravity and the gravitational field strength</h4>

<p>For a <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-313">1\ \text{kg}</script> mass near the Earth’s surface the gravitational field strength is given by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-314">\frac{\text{force of weight of a 1 kg mass}}{\text{1 kg}}</script>.</p>

<p>We also know that in free fall the acceleration of a <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-315">1\text{ kg}</script> mass when acted on by its weight has the values <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-316">9.81\text{ m s}^{-2}</script>, so the weight of a <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-317">1\text{ kg}</script> mass if <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-318">1 \times 9.81 = 9.81\text{ N}</script>.</p>

<p>This gives the gravitational field strength of the Earth at its surface to be <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-319">9.81\text{ N kg}^{-1}</script>.</p>



<h3 id="newtons-law-of-gravitation">Newton’s law of gravitation</h3>

<p>Two bodies that have mass will attract one another with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-320">F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}</script></p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-321">M</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-322">m</script> are the masses of the two bodies and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-323">r</script> is the separation of their centres.</p>

<h4 id="point-and-spherical-masses">Point and spherical masses</h4>

<p>Newton’s law of gravitation is stated for two point masses. However, a spherically symmetric mass can be considered to be a point mass, as if all of its mass were concentrated at its centre. <br>
Gravitational field lines act radially towards the centre for both a point and a spherical mass.</p>



<h4 id="gravitational-field-strength-g">Gravitational field strength, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-326">g</script></h4>

<p>For a body of mass <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-327">m</script> placed in the radial field of a spherical or point object, the size of the gravitational force is found at any point by using Newton’s law of gravitation.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-328">F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}</script></p>

<p>It follows that <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-329">g = -\frac{GMm}{mr^2} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}</script></p>

<h3 id="star-formation-and-life-cycle">Star formation and life cycle</h3>

<p><strong>Gravitational collapse</strong> The inward movement of material in a star due to the gravitational force caused by its own mass. Star formation is due to the gradual gravitational collapse of a cloud of gas and dust. Gravitational collapse occurs in a mature star when the internal gas and radiation pressure can no longer support the star’s own mass</p>

<p><strong>Radiation pressure</strong> is due to the momentum of photons released in fusion reactions, and acts outwards (in the direction of energy flow)</p>

<p><strong>Gas pressure</strong> <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-438">\rho</script> is related to the temperature, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-439">T</script>, and volume, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-440">V</script>, of a gas using <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-441">pV = nRT</script> and also to the mean square speed of the gas atoms using <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-442">pV = \frac 1 3 N m \overline{c^2}</script>. Gas pressure acts in all directions at a point inside a gas, such as inside a star</p>

<p><strong>Main sequence</strong> The main sequence is the main part of a star’s life cycle, this is where it is fusing hydrogen to form helium in its core. The main sequence stars are shown as a curved band on a plot of a stars Hertzsprung Russell diagram</p>

<p><strong>Chandrasekhar limit</strong> The maximum possible mass for a stable white dwarf star and is equal to 1.4 times the mass of our Sun. White dwarfs with masses above this will collapse to become neutron stars or black holes</p>

<p><strong>Low mass star</strong> A star with a mass below 1.4  times Chandrasekhar limit</p>

<p><strong>Red giant</strong> A star in the later stages of its life that has nearly exhausted the hydrogen in its core and is now fusing helium nuclei. It is bigger than a normal star because its surface layers have cooled and expanded</p>

<p><strong>White dwarf</strong> The end product of a low mass star, when the outer layers have dispersed into space, A white dwarf is very dense, with a high surface temperature and low luminosity</p>

<p><strong>Planetary nebula</strong> An expanding, glowing shell of ionised hydrogen and helium ejected from a red giant star at the end of its life</p>

<h4 id="process-of-star-formation">Process of star formation</h4>

<ul>
<li>In certain areas of space where dust and gas are present, they will slow come together through gravitational attraction between individual atoms, to form denser clumps of matter. Given enough time these areas will gradually become more dense. This is gravitational collapse</li>
<li>As the gravitational force pulls more matter together, work is done on the particles of dust and gas, leading to an increase in kinetic energy. This results in an increase in temperature until some of the denser areas of gas become hot enough to glow. This large core of material is called a protostar. Protostars can only be detected through telescopes designed to observe infrared radiation, as the clouds of gas and dust around them absorb and scatter most of the visible light.</li>
<li>The protostar’s gravitational field will continue to attract more matter until the temperature and pressure of the star becomes much greater. The temperature at the core of the star will reach several million degrees kelvin and the increased kinetic energy increases the probability that fusion reactions will begin.</li>
</ul>

<p>THe overall effect of the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to helium nuclei is that four protons are converted into one helium-4 nucleus with the production of two gamma ray photons, two neutrinos, and two positrons. <br>
During this process, energy will be released.</p>

<p>The momentum of the photons released by the fusion reactions leads to an outwards acting force called radiation pressure. <br>
In a star of stable size, the radiation pressure and the gas pressure are in equilibrium with the gravitational force acting inwards. At this point, the star becomes a main sequence star, where it will remain for the majority of its life, converting hydrogen to helium.</p>



<h4 id="development-of-stars">Development of stars</h4>

<p>Main sequence stars make up about 90% of the stars in the universe and fuse hydrogen to form helium in their cores. Our Sun, is about half way through its life. <br>
The mass of main sequence stars can vary from one tenth of the mass of our Sun to two hundred times the mass of the Sun. <br>
The greater the mass of a star, the shorter its life tends to be. The Sun has been in main sequence for around 4.6 billion years, and is estimated to have another 6.5 billion years before it moves off the main sequence. <br>
It currently has a power output of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-443">4\times10^{26}\ \text{W}</script>.</p>



<h4 id="low-mass-stars">Low mass stars</h4>

<p>If a star is less than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, it will move off the main sequence and first become a read giant before becoming a white dwarf. <br>
The process begins when most of the hydrogen nuclei present in the core have been fused into helium. Nuclear fusion will stop, meaning that the radiation pressure will also stop and the star will experience net inwards force due to gravitational attraction. The core will contract, leading to an increase in its temperature as it compresses. The large quantity of hydrogen surrounding the core will become hotter as the core continues to contract and releases thermal energy. These out layers expand to cover a greater volume than the original star, cooling and leading to the formation of a red giant.</p>

<p>Further contraction of the core by gravitational collapse will continue, and its temperature continues to rise. Eventually, the core becomes hot enough for fusion of helium nuclei to take place, leading to the production of heavier elements, including carbon and oxygen. <br>
Energy is released when these fusion reactions take place, increasing the radiation pressure outwards. Once the fusion of helium finishes, a low mass star cannot get hot enough for further fusion reactions so fusion stops. The star becomes unstable and begins to collapse again. At this stage, the outer layers of gas may be ejected back into space forming a planetary nebula. <br>
The rest of the star continues to collapse under its own mass and to heat up until it can collapse no further.  <br>
What is left is a hot dense core called a white dwarf. No further fusion reactions take place but the star continues to radiate energy as the photons produced from past fusion reactions leak away. Eventually, this white dwarf will cool down to a surface temperature of just a few kelvin.</p>



<h4 id="electron-degeneracy-pressure">Electron degeneracy pressure</h4>

<p>When matter is compressed into a very small volume such as the dense core of a collapsing star, the electrons are no longer free to move about between energy levels. As the star contracts, the compression forces electrons in neighbouring atoms into the lowest energy levels first and then into higher energy levels once the lowest unoccupied energy levels are filled. <br>
It is not possible for two or more electrons to occupy idential states in an energy level at the same time so when all of the available electron states are full, it is not possible to add another electron to a given volume. <br>
It is as if the electrons exert a repulsive outwards force.  <br>
If a star is not too massive, the electron degeneracy pressure prevents further gravitational collapse and a stable white dwarf is formed. The electron degeneracy pressure is only sufficient to prevent collapse of the star if the stellar remnant is less than the Chandrasekhar limit.</p>



<h4 id="high-mass-stars">High mass stars</h4>

<p>When larger more massive star move of the main sequence they are already much brighter than lower mass stars. The core contracts under gravity and heats up while the outer layers expand to many times to their original size to become a red super giant. <br>
As the core collapses and heats up, further nuclear fusion reactions can occur, with fusion of heavier and heavier elements possible at successively higher temperatures and pressures. <br>
In each stable fusion phase, the degeneracy pressure of electrons and radiation pressure prevent gravitational collapse. Fusion continues until an iron core builds up, and thenc ollapses. <br>
The fat of the red super giant then depends on the mass of the remaining core. If the mass is less than the Chandrasekhar limit the star will remain as a white dwarf. If the mass of the star’s core is greater than this, the electron degeneracy pressure will not be sufficient to support the core and the core will undergo gravitational collapse.</p>



<h4 id="supernovae">Supernovae</h4>

<p>The final collapse of the iron core amy only take a few days, during which the loss of gravitational potential energy produces intense heating. During the final seconds of the collapse of a red super giant, the immense gravitation pressure forces protons and electrons in the iron to combine to become neutrons. This triggers an explosive blowing out of the outer shell.</p>

<p>Although elements heavier than iron cannot be produced by fusion in stars, in a supernova elements heavier than iron can be formed when the remaining heavy nuclei capture, or fuse with, a neutron. <br>
The Earth and all of the elements contained within it are the remains of a supernova explosion.</p>



<h4 id="neutron-stars">Neutron stars</h4>

<p>Under certain conditions the extremely dense collapsed neutron core can remain intact after a supernova explosion. <br>
Its density is such that a neutron star of mass equal to that of the Sun would have a diameter of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-444">30\ \text{km}</script>. <br>
Some neutron stars rotate rapidly and emit highly directional bursts of electromagnetic waves. There is one such neutron star in the Crab Nebula, which is the core of the exploding star that caused the supernova. The magnetic field of the neutron star must be large, and the frequency at which the pulses of radiation are emitted is assumed to be the rate at which the star, and its magnetic field, rotates.</p>



<h4 id="black-holes">Black holes</h4>

<p>When the core mass is greater than three to four solar masses, the pressure of the core could become so large that the neutron star would collapse to a point at which the density would become infinite. <br>
If the density is high enough, the gravitational field in a region around the point will be so strong that nothing can escape it. <br>
This region is known as a black hole. <br>
In some binary star systems where one of the pair cannot be seen, its orbit can be inferred from the orbit of the visible star. <br>
It is possible that the other ‘star’ is a black hole.</p>

<h3 id="electromagnetic-radiation-from-stars">Electromagnetic radiation from stars</h3>

<p><strong>Continuous spectrum</strong> A spectrum which appears to contain all wavelengths over a particular range</p>

<p><strong>Energy levels</strong> Energy levels inside an atom are the specific energies that electrons can have when occupying specific orbits. Electrons can only occupy discrete energy levels and cannot exist at other energy values between them</p>

<p><strong>Emission line spectrum</strong>  The emission line spectrum of an element is the spectrum of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation emitted due to electron transitions from higher to lower energy levels within an atom of that element. Since there are so many possible transitions for each atom, there are many different radiated wavelengths. A line spectrum consists of a series of bright lines against a dark background</p>

<p><strong>Absorption line spectrum</strong> The pattern of dark lines between the lines in a continuous spectrum from a light source passing through an absorbing medium such as a gas. The dark lines represent the wavelengths that are absorbed</p>

<p><strong>Maxima</strong> The regions of brightness which will be seen when the path difference between overlapping waves is equal to an integer number of wavelengths</p>

If the electron is excited by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-448">E = hf</script> it will be promoted to a higher energy state.</p>

<p>The energy required to move it to another level is equal to the sum of the energy differences between the two levels.</p>

<p>Electromagnetic radiation of fixed energy <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-449">E</script> and and wavelength <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-450">\lambda</script> is emitted as the excited electron falls back to the lowest state.</p>

<p>The electrons can only ever be found in one of the energy levels, never in between. In order to change the state, the incoming electron must exactly match the energy gap.</p>



<h4 id="negative-energy">‘Negative energy’</h4>

<p>We define electrons as having zero energy when they are a long way from the nucleus. <br>
As the electron tends towards the nucleus from far away its energy decreases below zero, giving the energy levels within the atom negative energies. <br>
Hydrogens ground state is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-451">-13.6\text{ eV}</script>, meaning that <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-452">13.6\text{ eV}</script> is required to completely remove that electron from the atom (Ionisation).</p>
